To create a navbar with links for "Home," "About," and "Contact" along with a search functionality button, you can use React and implement state management using Context API. First, set up the context using NoteContext and then manage state in NoteState. You will import this context into the About.jsx component to update values using an update function from NoteState.

In NoteState, you will create the necessary functions and provide values to the context provider. In About.jsx, you will use the context to manage state changes dynamically. This allows for seamless updates across your application when the update function is called, showcasing the usage of React's Context API for state management in a functional navbar with search capabilities.
